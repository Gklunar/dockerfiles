# dockerfiles

Random Dockerfiles...

## Support status

I've published these `Dockerfiles` and associated images primarily for my own
personal use. Others are welcome to use them, however, under the terms of the
[license](./LICENSE).

I occasionally update this repo, but I make no guarantees and I don't provide
support for them. I also may remove some images from the repository for various
reasons, and make no backwards compatibility guarantees.

In other words - use at your own risk.
